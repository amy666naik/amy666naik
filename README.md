MannMitra is a confidential, AI-powered companion built on Google Cloud Generative AI. It helps students and young adults overcome stigma, track moods, practice mindfulness, and access crisis support â€” all in a culturally sensitive, stigma-free, and gamified way. I worked on this project alongside my teammate @gee-46 and continue committing new features and improvements every day.

<details>
<summary>Project highlights</summary>

- Built AI-assisted conversational flows and mood-tracking features.  
- Integrated cloud-based generative model endpoints for context-aware responses.  
- Focused on privacy-first UX and culturally sensitive content design.  
- Actively developing: new features and polishing UX are pushed frequently.
